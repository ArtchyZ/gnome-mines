   GNOME Mines is a puzzle game where you search for hidden mines. Flag the
   spaces with mines as quickly as possible to make the board a safer place and
   win the game. Be careful not to trigger one, or the game is over!
  </p>
  <p>
   When you click on a square, you'll find out if that square contained a mine.
   If so, the game is over. Otherwise, you'll find out the number of mines in
   adjacent squares. If no adjacent squares contain a mine, the safe portion of
   the board will be revealed, so you have more dangerous territory to work on.
  </p>
  <p>
   You can select the size of the field you want to play on at the start of the
   game. If you get stuck, you can ask for a hint: there's a time penalty, but
   that's better than hitting a mine!
